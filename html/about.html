	<p class="w3-text-gray">Mark Rothermund is a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech pursuing research in computational chemistry.
	He earned his Master of Science in Chemistry at Western Carolina University (WCU) performing chemometric 
	and analytical chemistry research headed by Dr. Scott Huffman with colaborative efforts between the 
	Chemistry and Human Health Departments at WCU, culminating in his master's thesis titled, "Application 
	of Infrared Spectroscopy and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis to Determine the Gonotrophic Stage 
	of <em>Aedes triseriatus</em>."
	<br><br>
	From his time at WCU, Mark has gained experience coding in Python, to perform chemometric analyses and create 
	plots acceptable for publication, and C from the course "Computer Interfacing" in which he and his team assembled
	a fluorometer and coded the Arduino that was used to control the detector and LED light source. Mark has taught 
	General Chemistry labs and an Introductory Physics lab as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). He took on the
	added responsibility of converting a General Chemistry lab procedure to a format readable by the browser-based 
	online lab simulator at <a href="https://www.chem21labs.com" target="_blank" class="w3-text-teal w3-hover-text-purple">Chem 21 Labs</a>, 
	and in doing so, 
	learned basic HTML and CSS.
	<br><br>
	Mark was born and raised in the city of Salisbury, NC. In his free time, Mark enjoys spending time with 
	his friends and family; playing with his dog, Beanz; gardening; learning new languages, both programming and 
	natural; honing his programming skills; and trying new things in general. If you would like to find out more 
	about Mark, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html" class="w3-text-teal w3-hover-text-purple">reach out</a>.
